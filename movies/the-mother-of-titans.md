# The mother of Titans

![poster aici]()

The land is now riddled with terror, dominated by hordes of titans thirsting for revenge against the gods, led by the great Cronus.

But who are these titans?! Their origin comes from the primordial parents, Uranus and Gaia who had 12 sons called Titans.
The Titans were the primordial gods, but were later dethroned by the Olympian gods Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera who are actually the offspring of Cronus and Rhea (pure titans).

Once they were dethroned, they were sent to Earth and Gaia, their mother, was forced to keep their dungeon.
